# Philly Theater Database

Automatically crawls the websites of Philly-area theaters to corral data about production history, award history, and demographic information over time.

## TODO

1. Implement a relational database (Postgres) for this simple example
2. Host this!
3. Come up with models/schema for theaters, artists, productions, etc.
