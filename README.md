# Philly Theater Database

Automatically crawls the websites of Philly-area theaters to corral data about production history, award history, and demographic information over time.

## TODO

1. Implement Prettier
2. Should I be using lerna?
3. Remove unneeded CRA cruft
4. Implement a relational database (Postgres) for this simple example
5. Host this!
6. Come up with models/schema for theaters, artists, productions, etc.
